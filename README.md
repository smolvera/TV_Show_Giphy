# TV_Show_Giphy:
This is my tv show giphy app. There are three preset tv show buttons at the top of the page labeled by the show name. 
When a button is clicked, 10 giphyies related to that show will line the page. Each giphy can be changed from still to 
animated when clicked on. Additional tv shows button's can be added to the page by search the title. When new button's 
are clicked on, theapi requests 10 giphyes related to the new tv show button.
